# pytorch-dataloader

![pytorch](images/pytorch.jpeg)

We use [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) extensively for numerous machine learning based solutions internally.
Hence, we expect at least a basic level of familiarity with [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)

In this task, you are supposed to go through [this tutorial on Data Loading and Processing in PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html), and because familiar with the PyTorch [DataLoader](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) class, and implement a
custom DataLoader for the PlantVillage Dataset.

You can download the dataset from the [crowdAI PlantVillage Disease Classification Challenge](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/plantvillage-disease-classification-challenge).
And the challenge page has more instructions about the dataset.

__NOTE__: The link to the `Test Data` is broken, so you are welcome to split the available `Training Data` into custom splits
of a configurablke
