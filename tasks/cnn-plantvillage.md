The task is to train a Deep Convolutional Neural Network to learn to differentiate between
`38` different classes of diseased plant leaves. This is a standard Image Classification problem,
and you can find numerous resources on getting started easily on Image Classification on your own dataset.

Some tutorials on training Deep Neural Networks on this dataset are available at :

* https://www.crowdai.org/articles/plantvillage-image-classification-tutorial

You can download the dataset from the [crowdAI PlantVillage Disease Classification Challenge](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/plantvillage-disease-classification-challenge).
And the challenge page has more instructions about the dataset, and the problem definition.

As a solution, you will have to create a publicly accessible repository, which implements an Image Classifier for this dataset.
Please include a description of the problem, your approach, the results (loss+accuracy plots) in the the README of your repository.
Then you can send a pull request by including a link to your repository in the section below.
