In this task you are supposed to implement [Neural Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04058.pdf) from scratch.
[Here](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html) is a great tutorial on how to get started on Neural Style Transfer.

You can follow the tutorial, implement the described Neural Style Transfer approach.
Then you can create a publicly accessible GitHub repository with your code, and a README describing the whole approach.
Please do remember to include samples of generated images in the README of your repository.

Then you can send a pull request by including a link to your repository in the section below.
